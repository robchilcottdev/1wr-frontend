        Important: this game is in a kind of open beta, and subject to breakage at any time. Stories do not currently persist between updates! Anybody 
        playing this does so at their own risk, but honestly, it's harmless and no personal data is being collected. It does use 
        browser local storage to persist your chosen user name, but that's about it. No other cookies or naughtiness.
        If something is broken, try clicking the 'refresh' link in the top right. You've probably arrived here entirely by accident, but anyway... have fun!

        Welcome to <strong>1WordRobin</strong> - a modern take on a classic childhood word game, and the perfect
        antidote to souless AI slop. Generative AI produces one word at a time, but only humans can produce real
         <strong>stories</strong> one word at a time.

    <p>
    <strong>1WordRobin</strong>
    is easy to play. Just start a story, share the story code or full URL 
    with your fellow authors, and take turns to add one
    word at a time. Democractically, the latest word can be edited only by the vote of an agreed number of authors
    (by default, the majority).
    </p><br/>
    <p>
        I hope you enjoy <strong>1WordRobin</strong>. One day, I'll hopefully get to release it properly!        
    </p><br/>
    <p class="mb-24"><strong>How it was made</strong>: backend in node.js with websockets hosted in Azure, frontend written in Angular, 
    open-sourced on GitHub for hosting.</p>
