        Welcome to <strong>1WordRobin</strong> - a modern take on a classic childhood word game, and the perfect
        antidote to souless AI slop. Generative AI produces one word at a time, but only humans can produce real
         <strong>stories</strong> one word at a time.

    <p>
    <strong>1WordRobin</strong>
    is easy to play. Just start a story, share your 
    <span class="uppercase border-1 rounded-md bg-neutral-500 text-white shadow-xs shadow-black text-xs p-0.5">
        story code</span> 
    with your fellow authors, and take turns to add one
    word at a time. Democractically, the latest word can be edited only by the vote of an agreed number of authors. 
    Once your story is complete, you can choose to save it for posterity and remember the fun you had along the way.
